# UsingBrushes
Experimenting with Brushes in WPF

This is a WPF application that explores the use of Brushes and how to use them to shade or fill shapes.

It is not intended to be a true MVVM structured application, but makes use of View Models and basic WPF Bindings

The solution demonstrates the creation of converters (ColourToSolidColourBrushConverter) and an extension method
for IEnumerable<T> to create an ObservableCollection<T> (ToObseervableCollection)
